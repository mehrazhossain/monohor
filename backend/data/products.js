      "Great sex can be an incredible way of bringing two people closer together. For a feeling of deep connection and real intense contact, a thinner condom can make all the difference. Durex Extra Thin condoms have been designed to provide the same high level of security and protection but are thinner for higher sensitivity. The condoms also smell better which helps avoid unpleasant distractions and you can relax and enjoy to the fullest. Each Durex condom is dermatologically tested to ensure strength and a high level of protection. No method of contraception can give you 100% protection against pregnancy, HIV or sexually transmitted infections. Please read the instructions, especially when using condoms for anal or oral sex. Try different Durex condoms or indulge in Durex’s Play range of lubricants and ring to make love-making comfortable and exciting!",
